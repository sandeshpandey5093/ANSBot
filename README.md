## Overview

The bot is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in the FinRL environment. The application consists of two tabs. Upon entering and submitting input values, ANSBot conducts trades in the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) market in the FinRL environment backend. It provides recommendations and evaluates the performance of the bot against the TSX index benchmark.
